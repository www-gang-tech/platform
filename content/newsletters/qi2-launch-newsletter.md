## What's New in Qi2

The key innovation is the **Magnetic Power Profile** \- devices and chargers use magnets to snap into perfect alignment\.

### Key Improvements

* **15W guaranteed** (vs inconsistent speeds in Qi v1)
* Perfect alignment every time via magnets
* Better energy efficiency (less heat waste)
* Unified ecosystem (no more proprietary fast charging)

## Who Benefits?

Everyone, eventually. While iPhones 12+ already support magnetic charging, Android manufacturers are building Qi2 into new flagships.

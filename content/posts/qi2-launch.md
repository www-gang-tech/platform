The Wireless Power Consortium's new **Qi2 standard** represents the biggest leap in wireless charging since 2008.

## What's New in Qi2

The key innovation is the **Magnetic Power Profile** - devices and chargers use magnets to snap into perfect alignment.

### Key Improvements

- **15W guaranteed** (vs inconsistent speeds in Qi v1)
- Perfect alignment every time via magnets  
- Better energy efficiency (less heat waste)
- Unified ecosystem (no more proprietary fast charging)

## Who Benefits?

Everyone, eventually. While iPhones 12+ already support magnetic charging, Android manufacturers are building Qi2 into new flagships.

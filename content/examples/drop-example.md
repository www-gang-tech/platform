# What's New

The Feed System is our take on modern content publishing:

- **7 content types**: note, shot, drop, product, update, link, sheet
- **Zero JavaScript**: Full functionality without client-side code
- **Machine-readable**: JSON-LD on every item
- **Syndication-ready**: Auto-generate email + social drafts

## Why Feed?

Traditional blogs force everything into "posts". We believe different content types deserve different structures:

- Quick thoughts don't need titles (**note**)
- Photos speak for themselves (**shot**)
- Launches deserve emphasis (**drop**)
- Products need structured data (**product**)

## Get Started

Drop a markdown file into `content/feed/` and we'll handle the rest.

In Q1 2025, we rebuilt our entire design system from scratch. The driver? An accessibility audit revealed 47 critical issues.

## The Problem

Our previous component library:
- No semantic HTML patterns
- Inconsistent ARIA attributes  
- Failed color contrast (3.2:1 on buttons)
- 23KB of JavaScript for basic interactions

## Results

- **100% WCAG 2.2 AA** compliance
- **8.7KB total** (CSS only, 0 JS for 80% of components)
- **Zero violations** in production for 3 months
